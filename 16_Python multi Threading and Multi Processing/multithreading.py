### Multithreading
## When to use Multi Threading
# I/O bound tasks => Thasks that spend more time waiting for I/O operations(e.g., file operations, network requests).
# Consurent excution => When you want to improve the throughput of your application by performing multiple operations concurrently.

import threading
import time

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f"Number: {i}")

def print_letter():
    for letter in "abcde":
        time.sleep(2)
        print(f"Letter: {letter}")

# create 2 thread
t1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
t2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letter)

t = time.time()

# start the thread
t1.start()
t2.start()

### wait for threads to complete
t1.join()
t2.join()

finished_time=time.time()-t

print(finished_time)
